[IPO underwriterâ€™s conflict of interest: When IPO underwriter has stake of the issuer](https://jhklee.github.io/research/) 
We study whether IPO over pricing exits in the case where the underwriter has a share of the issuer
 before the offering. Recent surge of private capital implies the run away from heavily regulated public
 assets and alarms the importance of studying private equity and venture capital. Gompers and Lerner
 (1999) argues that IPO underwriting by investment banks that hold equity in a firm through a venture
 capital subsidiary show no overpricing activities and opposes regulating underwriter venture capital
 investment. However, Gompers and Lerner (1999) did not consider the IPO lock up period. In this
 paper, we consider the 180 day lock up period and will verify whether the long term return changes
 before and after the 180 day threshold. We find that IPOs in which underwriters hold prior venture
 investments are overpriced and perform worse by about 9.2% to 10.2% than offerings in which no un
derwriter has a venture stake. Beyond regression analysis, this paper uses a difference-in-differences
 model by using affiliation of IPO as treatment and the 180 day period as the intervention date and
 reports that there exits about 2.5% over pricing in affiliated IPOs. Though both analysis show in
significant statistics at this moment, we are currently working on several methods to verify the results.
